        Frontend is everything that the user can see and interact with on e.g. a website.
        The <span id="colours"><b>colours</b></span> and <span id="font">font</span> of a text? Frontend.
        How about a <a href="buttons.html"><button>button</button></a> or an <img src="image1.png" alt="Image of note with text 'Image'" class=imageimage> then? Also Frontend.    

        A frontend developer often works with HTML, CSS and Javascript to create websites that look nice and that are interactive.
        Try clicking the button above.
        
        An important aspect of working with frontend is usability and the target audience of the website.
        For example, a site called timeoclock.com should display something like this. 
        <time>Current time: <strong><span class="time"></span></strong></time>

        Frontend is about creating websites that are user friendly, accessible and also look nice.
